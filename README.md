# agriPlot
Practical geospatial tools for agricultural field research planning and analysis

What is agriPlot? The core R function of agriPlot takes a fieldbook comprising an agricultural research experiment with a row column design and computes a latitude and longitude for each plot (i.e. entry) represented in the fieldbook. Once coordinates are assigned to individual plots, many geospatial operations can be carried out for subsequent analysis.
